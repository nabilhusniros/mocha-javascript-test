 **mocha-javascript-test**

This repository contains a simple Mocha test for a JavaScript function. The function, `add`, takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. The test, `testAdd`, checks that the function works correctly by calling it with different pairs of numbers and verifying that the result is correct.

**Getting Started**

To run the test, you will need to have Node.js and Mocha installed. You can install Node.js from the Node.js website, and you can install Mocha by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g mocha
```

Once you have Node.js and Mocha installed, you can run the test by opening a terminal window and navigating to the directory where the `mocha-javascript-test` repository is located. Then, run the following command:

```
mocha
```

This will run the test and output the results to the terminal window.

**Code Explanation**

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code in the `mocha-javascript-test` repository:

1. The first line of the `add` function declares the function and its two parameters, `a` and `b`.
2. The second line of the `add` function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
3. The `testAdd` function is a Mocha test that checks that the `add` function works correctly.
4. The first line of the `testAdd` function declares the test and its name, "should add two numbers correctly".
5. The second line of the `testAdd` function calls the `assert.equal()` function to check that the result of calling the `add` function with the numbers 1 and 2 is equal to 3.
6. The third line of the `testAdd` function calls the `done()` function to signal that the test is complete.

**Conclusion**

This repository contains a simple Mocha test for a JavaScript function. The function, `add`, takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. The test, `testAdd`, checks that the function works correctly by calling it with different pairs of numbers and verifying that the result is correct.
